# Message Maps 
## Discover your strategy - Perfect your message - Make selling simple

...

Message Maps solves this problem for B2B technology firms: **not having as much revenue as you could**.

It's a simple tool optionally packaged with a strategy and messaging consulting service from Message Maps. 

It can be packaged with similar services from 3rd parties: marketing strategy, lead gen services, outbound sales, or product development.

However, it can also used _separately_ from consulting services in a self-serve way. 

If *you*'d like to try it self-service for free in exchange for feedback, please get in touch before the Oct. 5th release!
